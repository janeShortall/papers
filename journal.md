# Introduction
Haywood et al (1999) made some great measurements of BBOA over the Sahara.
We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectrometer (Allen et al 2000).

# Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model. It reproduces the groth in size distribution observed and suggests coagulation as the dominant method of growth.

# Methodology
We used AMS (Allan et al 1999) to measure particle mass and chemical composition.
