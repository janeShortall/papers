# Introduction
Haywood et al (1999) made some great measurements of BBOA over the Sahara.
We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectrometer (Allen et al 2000).

# Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model. It reproduces the groth in size distribution observed and suggests coagulation as the dominant method of growth.

# Methodology
We used AMS (Allan et al 1999) to measure particle mass and chemical composition.

# Results
We observed particle growth through coagulation and report the changing chemical composition with age in the atmosphere. 

# Conclusions 
We made some discovery aren't we great, give us more funding.

# Figures
This is where the figures go in a draft manuscript.

# Aknowledgements
We would like to thank the funding body for their support.
